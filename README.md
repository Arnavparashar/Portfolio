# Arnav Parashar — Portfolio

This project is a Next.js portfolio and blog optimized for a modern, bold theme inspired by fitness-style sites (dark theme + orange accent). It includes API routes for Projects, Blog and Contact.

## Quick start

1. Copy environment variables: `cp .env.local.example .env.local` and configure `MONGODB_URI` and `SENDGRID_API_KEY`.
2. Install dependencies:
   npm install
3. Run dev server:
   npm run dev

## Deployment
- This project is configured to deploy to Vercel easily. Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard and deploy.

## Notes
- API routes currently return mock data. I'll add DB models and seeding next.
- Resume link and social links are wired to your provided URLs.
